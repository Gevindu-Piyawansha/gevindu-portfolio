            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am an aspiring fullstack developer with a strong background in Java and modern web technologies. After a successful career in Civil Engineering, I transitioned to software development and completed the Comprehensive Master Java Developer diploma (IJSE), along with an MSc in Civil Construction and Real Estate Management from Riga Technical University.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a Norwegian residence permit with full work rights, am fluent in English, and currently learning Norwegian. I enjoy building practical applications with Java, Spring Boot, React, and related technologies. I am now seeking junior developer or internship roles in Norway and am open to relocation within the country.
